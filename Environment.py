# The QX are obtained by multiplying the piston velocity given in Kharecha's paper (cm.s-1) by the depth of the mixing

# The Xinf for H2, CO2, and CH4 are obtained by multiplying the partial atmospheric pressure in X (assumed fixed for now, 
# and for an atmospheric pressure of 1 bar) by the the solubility of the chemical element (the mixing ratios of H2, CO2, 
# CH4 are assumed to be equal to 1000, 2500, and 10 ppm respectively). It is fixed arbitrarily for NH4:
